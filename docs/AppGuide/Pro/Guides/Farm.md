### Zero Price Impact Zap

On Pendle, users have the option to activate **Zero Price Impact Mode**, which allows them to provide liquidity to the PT/SY pool without affecting the price. Normally, when liquidity is added, a portion of the underlying asset is used to purchase PT from the PT/SY pool, and the rest is wrapped into SY. However, this purchase of PT can cause a price impact.

With **Zero Price Impact Mode** enabled, the underlying asset is fully wrapped into SY, a portion of which is used to mint PT and YT. The PT and remaining SY are then used for liquidity provision, with the YT returned to the user's wallet. This eliminates the step of purchasing PT, thereby avoiding any potential price impact.
